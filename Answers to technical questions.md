1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
	I spent around 10 hours in total (2 Friday in detailed analysis , 3 Saturday, 5 Monday). 
	If I had more time I would add a css styles to improve the front-end, manage the search by page in a better way, order the code and abstract the code the most posible (implementing mvc and html5), generate an event log
	and make the other bonus about showing the field "signal" in a striking way (sorry for this).
   
2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
	In the first instance when I read the instruction of the test, I had decided to use jquery (it was open), then in the questions about the exercise I gave priority to work with node js.
	The code that I worked on is simple and functional: I used routines to upload the server, route and handle events with basic html and finally consume the API of the exercise with json.
	As an open source platform, the js node has updates very often and they are interesting (even more because it belongs to Google), I read the last upgrades (2018) but I did not have to use them.
  
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
	Is important in every application in production has a log for searching errors and save the main events, furthermore I consider use any aditional tool, for example:
	Sitescope of HP for monitoring the resources at every level of one application and servers.
	In my current job I am in charge of the Virtual Banking and any problem of customer in production we have to act and solve as well as to prevent the issues.

4. How would you improve the Knetik APIs that you just used? 
   I would improve the knetik API implementing the sorting by any field, and creating the new methods and data (such as catalogues by example location name, parent location name, not just the code) 
   to be used in the final responses in order to facilitate the understanding of the API for the clients.

5. Please describe yourself using JSON.
   I am an Technical leader of projects of TI and my main role is to be an Engineer of integration in middleware layer with enphasis in the developement and maintinance of app for web and mobile for the banking business. 
   The interaction with diferent web services (soap and json) is my daily work. Currently I am working in a design of a new app mobile of the bank with development of rest full services with json, I dominate this technology.
